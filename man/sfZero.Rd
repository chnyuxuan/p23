\title{Zero Interim Alpha Spending Function}
\usage{
sfZero(alpha, t, param = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{alpha}{Type I error (one-sided) to be spent overall, usually 0.025.}

\item{t}{A vector of points with values between 0 and 1 inclusive, indicating the information fraction or timing at each analysis.}

\item{param}{A placeholder parameter kept for compatibility with the \code{gsDesign} spending function template. It is not used in the calculation. Default is NULL.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{spendfn} with values:
\describe{
\item{name}{The character string "Zero Interim Spending"}
\item{param}{The parameter value (NULL for this function)}
\item{parname}{The character string "none"}
\item{sf}{The function \code{sfZero} itself}
\item{spend}{A vector of cumulative alpha spent at each analysis}
\item{bound}{Boundary values (returns NULL as it is calculated by \code{gsDesign})}
\item{prob}{Probabilities associated with bounds (returns NULL)}
}
}
\description{
This function defines a custom alpha spending function for a group sequential design
where exactly 0 alpha is spent at all interim analyses ($t < 1$), and the full
overall alpha is spent at the final analysis ($t = 1$).
}
\examples{
# Example: 3-stage design using sfZero for the upper bound
library(gsDesign)

design <- gsDesign(
  k = 3, 
  test.type = 4, 
  alpha = 0.025, 
  beta = 0.1, 
  sfu = sfZero, 
  sfupar = NULL, 
  sfl = sfHSD, 
  sflpar = -2
)

print(design)
